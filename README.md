Mozfee
======

[MozRepl](https://github.com/bard/mozrepl) + [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) + Î±.

MozRepl is a Firefox addon that enables you to access inside Firefox from outside (e.g. terminal).
Though it is awesome, it lacks features like CoffeeScript support, command line eval and so on.

Mozfee aims to cover these features.

Install
-------

Mozfee is installed using [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/).

    npm install mozfee -g

Usage
-----

`mozfee` command without any options will invoke a MozRepl REPL with CoffeeScript.

    $ mozfee
    mozfee> repl.enter content
    [object Window] - {window: {...}, document: {...}, InstallTrigger: {...}, location: {...}, sh_requests: {...}, sh_isEmailAddress: function() {...}, sh_setHref: function() {...}, ...}
    mozfee> document.title
    "mozfee"

### How to end the REPL

* repl.quit() or
* ctrl-c/ctrl-d

### Writing multiline code

Ending the line with '\' will enable continuation mode. 
Continuation mode continues untill you pass an empty line.

    mozfee> f = (x)-> \
    ......>     console.log x
    ......>     x
    ......>
    function() {...}
    mozfee>
